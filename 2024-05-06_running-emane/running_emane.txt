Running Emane

Let's try and run the examples in 'emane-tutorial'. So do the 
git clone:

$ git clone git@github.com:adjacentlink/emane-tutorial.git

Then follow this guide for Ubuntu 18.04:
https://github.com/adjacentlink/emane-tutorial/wiki/Install

There is an instruction to install the necessary packages:
$ sudo apt install lxc bridge-utils mgen fping gpsd gpsd-clients \
iperf multitail olsrd openssh-server python-tk python-pmw python-lxml \
python-stdeb build-essential

I replaced 'apt-get' with 'apt'...

Now this is tricky, because some of the package are not available (I think in
Ubuntu 22.04).

Package python-stdeb is not available, but is referred to by another package.
This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
is only available from another source
However the following packages replace it:
  python3-stdeb

Package olsrd is not available, but is referred to by another package.
This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
