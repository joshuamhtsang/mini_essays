At the time of writing the version of Python is 3.12.2 (April 2024).

When you create a new directory, create a Python file (*.py) and open it in VS Code,
the bottom right of will indicate the Python interpreter you're using.

Venv setup:
https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments#_using-the-create-environment-command

Using command-palette "ctrl-shift-p" or clicking on the search bar at the top and entering ">" one can select 
the option: ">Python: Create Environment".  Just follow the recommended settings.

This will create a '.venv' directory, and VS Code will automatically detect and switch the current
interpreter to say 'Python 3.12.2 ('.venv': venv)' so you know you're in the venv.  Annoyingly,
Powershell will not show the name of the current venv in the prompt!  But it is in the venv.  To make it actually
show in the prompt execute the following in Powershell:
PS C:\Users\joshu\Documents\python_mucking_around> Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force

Then execute:
PS C:\Users\joshu\Documents\python_mucking_around> .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

Now you can do stuff with pip like:
(.venv) PS C:\Users\joshu\Documents\python_mucking_around> pip freeze
(.venv) PS C:\Users\joshu\Documents\python_mucking_around> pip install pygame

etc.
